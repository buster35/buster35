### Hi there 👋

Ambitious and adaptable developer; I have a fundamental understanding of relevant front & back-end technologies, and I envision my programming repertoire growing as I continue my quest to learn more languages. I truly admire the wide array of computing languages and the practical uses each serve to accomplish, both niche and mainstream. 

🌱 I’m currently learning Kotlin!
