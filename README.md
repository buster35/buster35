### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Ambitious and adaptable; I have built a solid foundation in building MERN-based projects and I envision my programming repertoire growing as I continue my quest to learn more languages. I truly admire the wide array of computing languages and the practical uses each serve to accomplish, both niche and mainstream.
